#🚀 Income Prediction Model (Machine Learning)
Project Overview: Developed a predictive model to classify individuals into income brackets (>$50K or ≤$50K) based on demographic and employment attributes. This project demonstrates the full data science lifecycle, from rigorous data cleaning to model deployment.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Language: Python

Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

🧠 Key Skills & Implementation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed deep-dive analysis on features like education, age, and occupation to identify key correlations with income levels.

Feature Engineering: Implemented One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables and utilized StandardScaler to normalize numerical data for better model convergence.

Handling Imbalance: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance within the dataset.

Model Selection: Evaluated multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Optimization: Conducted Hyper-parameter Tuning using GridSearchCV to maximize the F1-Score and ROC-AUC metrics.

📈 Results
Achieved an accuracy of [Insert Your %] and an F1-score of [Insert Your %].

Identified "Education Level" and "Hours per Week" as the top two predictors of high income.
